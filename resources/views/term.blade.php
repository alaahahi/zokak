    <p class="p-">
    Any contests, sweepstakes or other promotions (collectively, “Promotions”) made available through Service may be governed by rules that are separate from these Terms of Service.

    5.Subscriptions
    </h2>
    <p class="p-">
    Some parts of Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles will be set depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.
   </p>
   <p class="p-">
   At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Eventy cancels it.
